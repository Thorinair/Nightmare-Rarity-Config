# Nightmare Rarity Config
This repository hosts the newest version of configuration files and any other customized files for Thorinair's [Nightmare Rarity](https://www.thingiverse.com/thorinair/collections/nightmare-rarity) 3D printer. Specifically, the files are designed for integration with the [Marlin Firmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin).

The purpose of this repository is so others can inspect my configuration more easily, and so I have a backup of the files somewhere.

## Details
* **Config Version:** v1.0.0 (2020-11-04)
* **Marlin Version:** 2.0.5.2
